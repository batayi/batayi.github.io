    Client: Zipline · Location: Multiple regions across Ghana<br>
    Role: Project lead for UAV data acquisition and orthomosaic creation<br>
    Tools: DJI Phantom 4 RTK · Photogrammetry software (e.g. Agisoft Metashape) · GIS viewers
  </div>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Goal –</strong> Map the surroundings of health facilities to give Zipline a clear understanding of terrain and obstacles before sending health-delivery drones.</li>
    <li><strong>Data –</strong> High-overlap UAV imagery over ~250 × 250 m areas centred on each facility, covering buildings, open spaces and nearby obstacles.</li>
    <li><strong>Workflow –</strong> Site selection with Zipline → flight planning → UAV image capture with DJI Phantom 4 RTK → photogrammetric processing → orthomosaics ready for route planning.</li>
    <li><strong>Result –</strong> High-resolution orthomosaics that Zipline planners can use to design safe, efficient flight paths for emergency medical deliveries.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Acquisition</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Worked with Zipline to identify priority health facilities across several regions in Ghana.</li>
    <li>Planned UAV missions to cover approximately <strong>250 × 250 metres</strong> around each facility, capturing both the building and surrounding terrain.</li>
    <li>Flew a <strong>DJI Phantom 4 RTK</strong> with high forward and side overlap to ensure accurate photogrammetric reconstruction.</li>
    <li>Ensured consistent altitude and coverage so that planners could clearly see potential landing approaches and obstacles.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Processing & Mapping</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Processed imagery in photogrammetry software (e.g. <strong>Agisoft Metashape</strong>) to generate high-resolution orthomosaics.</li>
    <li>Georeferenced outputs so they could be easily integrated into Zipline’s internal planning tools and GIS viewers.</li>
    <li>Checked image quality, alignment and coverage around each health facility to ensure reliable inputs for flight planning.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Impact & Results</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provided Zipline with clear, up-to-date maps of the terrain around health facilities, including open areas, trees and built-up zones.</li>
    <li>Helped planners understand which approach directions were safest before dispatching their health-delivery drones.</li>
    <li>Improved the reliability and safety of emergency medical drops by giving operations teams a spatial view of each site.</li>
  </ul>
